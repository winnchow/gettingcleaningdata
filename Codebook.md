## Data dictionary of the output ##

The variables of the output:

- subject : the subject, ID
- activity : the activity label

All the following variables are aggregated by taking the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. All the variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1] before aggregation. Thus, they have NO units.

- tBodyAcc.mean.X : the mean of body acceleration in the X direction (time)
- tBodyAcc.mean.Y : the mean of body acceleration in the Y direction (time)
- tBodyAcc.mean.Z : the mean of body acceleration in the Z direction (time)
- tBodyAcc.std.X : the standard deviation of body acceleration in the X direction (time)
- tBodyAcc.std.Y : the standard deviation of body acceleration in the Y direction (time)
- tBodyAcc.std.Z : the standard deviation of body acceleration in the Z direction (time)
- tGravityAcc.mean.X : the mean of gravity acceleration in the X direction (time)
